## Some hands on examples of Machine Learning/Math concepts animation using Manim library in Python.

I have tried coding some examples on the manim (Mathematical Animation Engine in Python) used by [3blue1brown](https://www.youtube.com/c/3blue1brown/) in his videos for creating 2D/3D graphics and explaining mathematics concepts. 
I followed [Todd Zimmerman's](https://talkingphysics.wordpress.com/2019/01/08/getting-started-animating-with-manim-and-python-3-7/) tutorials from his "Getting started in manim" blog on wordpress. 
#### \#First Task *([Video link](https://drive.google.com/file/d/156d8WIhoohI9yXU5qednAtpU9PaLb4ff/view?usp=sharing))*
- First basic task I completed in manim is - plotting sine and cosine functions using the Graph object of manim. 

#### \#Second Task *([Video1 link](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1OJJnJdfNmkEtnVIpMN8N6hq7FnEhj9hA/view?usp=sharing)) / ([Video2 link](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1wh2-sZmy3-aA_0UzH421mXDKiZpP64fy/view?usp=sharing))*
- Second one is a little more complicated task where I have tried plotting the Iris data set. I have first plotted the features in 2D graph of manim and then applyed PCA on it to reduce the features to two from the original four. ( Reducing the feature comes under the 'feature selection' topic of Machine Learning. 
Feature selection has many advantages like 2D/3D visualization of the dataset, less memory consumption, reducing computational power in training models, 
reducing high number of features (>500 sometimes) in ML problem, etc.)
- In my example I have tried simply to visualize the (4 column) dataset of Iris plants in 2 dimensions, which helps us in classifying the plant in one of the 3 classes(Setosa, Versicolor, Virginica).
